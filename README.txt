This app is for tracking a particular cricket match. It has following properties:
1. Each team will get 5 overs, ie, 5*6=30 balls(which will be counted with corresponding variable).
2. The buttons' label tells the increment either in number of Runs or Wickets(max 10).
3. TEAM A plays first, hence A's innings needs be tracked through inputting the runs and wickets fall.
4. TEAM B always play after TEAM A, so, with each input, the score is compared and if the result is deducable, then the
result is displayed.
